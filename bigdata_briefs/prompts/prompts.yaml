    Generate a market-focused update on **{{entity_info}}** based on the recent information below. The following context contains a list of questions and the corresponding news texts that can potentially contain the answer to those questions. Today is {{current_datetime}}.

    <context>
    {{rendered_qapairs}}
    </context>
    
    <instructions>
      - Your objective is to analyze and summarize the novel and actionable information from the news texts
      - Your summary must contain specific details (e.g. numbers, dates, etc.)
      - Each paragraph must be distinct from the others, self-contained, and capture a unique theme. Merge relevant points into a larger paragraph if necessary.
      - Today is {{current_datetime}}. Focus only on actionable, novel information related to {{entity_info}}.
      - If there are any reporting dates mentioned in the news text contextualizing some events, only focus on those that occur from {{start_date}} to {{end_date}}.
      - You should completely ignore any information older than {{start_date}}.
      - Do not include any information related to news about **stock prices**.
      - If there are no interesting details or all developments focus on dates prior to {{start_date}}, or the topic is not directly related to {{entity_info}}, you should respond with:
        ```json 
        {% raw %}
        {
          "collection":["topic": "No new information to report.",
          "relevance_score": 1,
          "source_attribution": [1]
        }
        {% endraw %}
        ```
    </instructions>

    <style>
      - Write like a seasoned Wall Street desk analyst.
      - Should read like a quick "morning desk note": direct, no fluff, concise, and confident.
      - Only use the information present in the <context>. Do NOT infer from outside knowledge.
      - Generate a list of short paragraphs: **one short paragraph covers one specific topic or theme**.
      - Each paragraph starts with a bullet point.
      - The first bullet point should introduce the entity: **Full Company Name** (TICKER, if available) [active verb] [key event/action] [location if relevant], [specific details with metrics].
      - Subsequent bullets about the same entity should use natural sentence flow without repeating the full name - start with "The company" or a pronoun, maintaining proper grammar while preserving the dense, information-packed style.
      - All bullets must be complete sentences that read like a professional desk analyst's notes - concise yet grammatically correct.
      - Do NOT use explainers or generic summarizations, present the information and let the reader interpret the context.
      - Concise and extremely dense, presenting a large volume of information efficiently.
      - Use standard industry abbreviations for brevity and clarity.
      - Make use of financial and industry-specific terminology, assuming familiarity with market concepts (e.g., "FFO," "bp," "yields").
      - Use **bold** to emphasize company names.
      - Accurately report dates and figures when mentioned in the source text.
      - Do not report the same date in multiples paragraphs of the same entity.
      - Do not use colons to separate short paragraphs from details.
      - Avoid unnecessary sentences that link questions and answers. Only summarize the answer text.
    </style>

    <relevance_score>
      For each short paragraph you identified, assign a relevance score from 1 (low) to 5 (high) based on actionability, materiality, and market impact:
      - **1**: Irrelevant or contains no new information (e.g., recycled news, trivial updates).
      - **2**: Barely relevant or generally not actionable (e.g., participation in industry events, routine commentary, non-specific trends).
      - **3**: Moderately relevant but minimally actionable (e.g., awards, routine company updates, minor product tweaks, class action lawsuits).
      - **4**: Relevant and actionable, with potential material impact (e.g., new product launches, earnings in line with expectations, significant layoffs, large settlements or lawsuits).
      - **5**: Highly relevant and extremely actionable, with substantial market impact (e.g., M&A announcements, bankruptcy filings, executive departures, significant earnings surprises or misses, major regulatory actions, winning or losing key contracts, massive market price moves, etc.).

      Topics related to stock price movements and topics not directly related to **{{entity_info}}** should be scored **1**, they are not interesting and you should ignore them.

      Sort the topics by relevance score in descending order. If there are multiple topics with the same relevance score, sort them by the first date mentioned in the text.
    </relevance_score>

    <source_citation>
      - When you use information from a specific chunk in your paragraphs, you must cite it using the metadata provided in the context.
      - The citations should be reported for each paragraph where the information is used.
      - For every text used, report the Reference ID. The citation format should be an array constructed as follows: [X,Y,...], where X and Y are the Reference IDs.
      - If there are multiple sources for a particular piece of information, cite ALL the relevant sources in the array.

    The following context contains a report for a single company.

    <context>
    {{report}}
    </context>

    <instructions>
    1. **Objective**  
       - Extract the single most important, actionable development from this company's report.
       - Today is {{current_datetime}}. Focus only on novel, market-moving information.
       - Create one high-impact bullet point that captures the key takeaway an investor needs to know.

    2. **Style**  
       - **Direct, concise, and information-dense.**
       - Use **bold** for the company name to aid quick scanning.
       - Focus on the "so what" for investors; no fluffy transitions.
       - Keep the tone professional but energetic, as if briefing a busy Portfolio Manager.
       - Include specific numbers, dates, and quantifiable metrics whenever available.
       - Use active voice and precise language.

    3. **Content Requirements**
       - Select the most significant developments from the company report.
       - If multiple developments are mentioned, prioritize based on:
         * Financial impact (revenue, margins, guidance changes)
         * Strategic shifts (M&A, partnerships, pivots)
         * Regulatory/legal developments
         * Market position changes
       - Avoid speculative implications unless explicitly stated in the source material.
       - Focus exclusively on factual, concrete developments rather than potential impacts.

    4. **Length**  
       - Exactly one bullet point.
       - Target 25-40 words for maximum impact and readability.
       - Every word should add value - no filler.

    5. **What to Avoid**  
       - **No intros** or context-setting. Jump straight into the development.
       - Overly formal language, obscure jargon, or unnecessary detail.
       - **No generic observations** - the point must contain specific, actionable information.
       - **No fluff**. Every word should serve a purpose.
       - Avoid starting with phrases like "The company announced" or "According to the report"
