    Generate a market-focused update on **{{entity_info}}** based on the recent information below. The following context contains a list of questions and the corresponding news texts that can potentially contain the answer to those questions. Today is {{current_datetime}}.

    {% if topics %}

    The following topics are of particular interest for this report:

    <instructions>
      - Your objective is to analyze and summarize the novel and actionable information from the news texts
      - Your summary must contain specific details (e.g. numbers, dates, etc.)
      - Each paragraph must be distinct from the others, self-contained, and capture a unique theme. Merge relevant points into a larger paragraph if necessary.
      - Today is {{current_datetime}}. Focus only on actionable, novel information related to {{entity_info}}.
      {% if topics %} - When prioritizing information, give preference to developments that relate to the areas of interest listed above.{% endif %}
      - If there are any reporting dates mentioned in the news text contextualizing some events, only focus on those that occur from {{start_date}} to {{end_date}}.
      - You should completely ignore any information older than {{start_date}}.
      - Do not include any information related to news about **stock prices**.
      - If there are no interesting details or all developments focus on dates prior to {{start_date}}, or the topic is not directly related to {{entity_info}}, you should respond with:
        ```json 
        {% raw %}
        {
          "collection":["topic": "No new information to report.",
          "relevance_score": 1,
          "source_attribution": [1]
        }
        {% endraw %}
        ```
    </instructions>

    <style>
      - Write like a seasoned Wall Street desk analyst.
      - Should read like a quick "morning desk note": direct, no fluff, concise, and confident.
      - Only use the information present in the <context>. Do NOT infer from outside knowledge.
      - Generate a list of short paragraphs: **one short paragraph covers one specific topic or theme**.
      - Each paragraph starts with a bullet point.
      - The first bullet point should introduce the entity: **Full entity Name** (TICKER, if entity is a company and is available) [active verb] [key event/action] [location if relevant], [specific details with metrics].
      - Subsequent bullets about the same entity should use natural sentence flow without repeating the full name - start with "The <entity type, such as company, person, place..>" or a pronoun, maintaining proper grammar while preserving the dense, information-packed style.
      - All bullets must be complete sentences that read like a professional desk analyst's notes - concise yet grammatically correct.
      - Do NOT use explainers or generic summarizations, present the information and let the reader interpret the context.
      - Concise and extremely dense, presenting a large volume of information efficiently.
      - Use standard industry abbreviations for brevity and clarity.
      - Make use of financial and industry-specific terminology, assuming familiarity with market concepts (e.g., "FFO," "bp," "yields").
      - Use **bold** to emphasize entity names.
      - Accurately report dates and figures when mentioned in the source text.
      - Do not report the same date in multiples paragraphs of the same entity.
      - Do not use colons to separate short paragraphs from details.
      - Avoid unnecessary sentences that link questions and answers. Only summarize the answer text.
    </style>

    <relevance_score>
      For each short paragraph you identified, assign a relevance score from 1 (low) to 5 (high) based on how significantly the information affects or meaningfully relates to **{{entity_info}}**, considering actionability, materiality, influence, or real-world impact on the entity’s status, behavior, or perception:

      - **1**: Irrelevant or contains no meaningful new information about {{entity_info}}  
        Examples: recycled news, trivial mentions, tangential references, general market/industry commentary that does not specifically affect {{entity_info}}.  
        *Any topic related only to general market or price movements and not directly tied to {{entity_info}} should be scored 1.*

      - **2**: Barely relevant or weakly actionable  
        Examples: passing mentions, routine appearances (e.g., participation in events, public statements without consequences), non-specific trends, minor rumors, non-material updates.

      - **3**: Moderately relevant with limited actionability or impact  
        Examples: awards, routine updates, mild public scrutiny, minor product or policy changes, small-scale incidents, class-action filings, local or short-lived effects on {{entity_info}}.

      - **4**: Relevant and actionable with potential material or reputational impact  
        Examples:  
          • For **companies/products**: product launches, earnings in line, large layoffs, notable settlements, regulatory warnings.  
          • For **people**: major appointments, significant controversies, legally meaningful actions, endorsements with broad reach.  
          • For **places**: impactful policy changes, major infrastructure developments, significant demographic or economic shifts.  
          • For **events/organizations**: influential announcements, substantial operational updates, meaningful victories or losses.

      - **5**: Highly relevant, extremely actionable, with substantial direct impact on {{entity_info}}  
        Examples:  
          • For **companies/products**: M&A, bankruptcy, major regulatory actions, key contract wins/losses, massive surprises (earnings, failures, breakthroughs).  
          • For **people**: resignations or appointments to major roles, large-scale legal events, major awards or scandals with global attention.  
          • For **places**: catastrophes, major geopolitical developments, transformative policy shifts, large-scale economic events.  
          • For **events/organizations**: dissolutions, mergers, landmark achievements, sanctions, or major governance changes.

      For entity types non mentioned above, apply the same principles of actionability, materiality, and direct impact when assigning relevance scores.
      Sort the topics by relevance score in descending order. If there are multiple topics with the same relevance score, sort them by the first date mentioned in the text.
    </relevance_score>

    2. **Style**  
       - **Direct, concise, and information-dense.**
       - Use **bold** for the entity name to aid quick scanning.
       - Focus on the "so what" for investors; no fluffy transitions.
       - Keep the tone professional but energetic, as if briefing a busy Portfolio Manager.
       - Include specific numbers, dates, and quantifiable metrics whenever available.
       - Use active voice and precise language.

    3. **Content Requirements**
      - Select the most significant developments related to entity from the report.

          * **Strategic or structural shifts** (e.g., mergers, appointments, alliances, policy changes, major initiatives, directional changes)
          * **Regulatory, legal, or governmental actions** (e.g., investigations, new laws, sanctions, court rulings)
          * **Changes in status, influence, or position** (e.g., competitive standing, geopolitical significance, leadership roles, technological relevance)
      - Avoid speculative statements or interpretations unless they are explicitly supported by the source material.

       - **No intros** or context-setting. Jump straight into the development.
       - Overly formal language, obscure jargon, or unnecessary detail.
       - **No generic observations** - the point must contain specific, actionable information.
       - **No fluff**. Every word should serve a purpose.
       - Avoid starting with phrases like "The company announced" or "According to the report"
